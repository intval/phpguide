/*
 * The ESaveRelatedBehavior enables ActiveRecord models to save HAS_MANY relational
 * active records and MANY_MANY relations along with the main model.
 * It provides two new methods:
 *  - saveWithRelated - saves the model and all specified related models, returns false if any model has not been saved
 *  - saveRelated - saves the specified related models only and returns false if any model has not been saved
 *
 * Features:
 * - handles many_many and has_many relations
 * - fills has_many relations with validated objects
 * - allows selection of scenario for has_many relations
 * - processes everything within a transaction
 * - relations can be set with data arrays or object arrays
 * - only specified relations are saved
 * - massive assignment works, since data is set on relation directly
 * - adds 2 methods to activeRecord, no use of beforeSave/afterSave,
 *   therefore the behavior can be added to all activeRecord classes,
 *   it will only do its work when the new methods are called
 * - uses standard SQL
 * - NO HANDLING OF COMPOSITE KEYS yet
 *
 * Requirements:
 * Yii Framework 1.1.0 or later
 *
 * Usage:
 * Extract the release file under 'protected/components'
 * Add the following code to your models:
 * public function behaviors(){
 * 		return array('ESaveRelatedBehavior' => array(
 *          'class' => 'application.components.ESaveRelatedBehavior')
 *      );
 * }
 *
 * MANY_MANY relations
 * -------------------
 * When a MANY_MANY relation is defined in the relations() function,
 * instances of the foreign model can be related while saving the model.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * post model defines many_many relation with categories:
 * 'categories'=>array(self::MANY_MANY, 'category', 'post_category(post_id, category_id)')
 *
 * To add new rows to the m:n table (post_category) do:
 * $post = new post();
 * $post->categories = category::model()->findAll();
 * $post->saveWithRelated('categories');
 * This saves the new post and updates the m:n table with every category.
 *
 * The typical usage to assign data send from a checkBoxList is
 * $post->categories = array(1, 2, 3);
 * $post->saveWithRelated('categories');
 *
 * So you can either pass an array of objects
 * or an array of the primary keys of the foreign table.
 *
 * You can also pass a single object or a single primary key:
 * $post->categories = category::model()->findByPk(1);
 * $post->categories = 1;
 * $post->saveWithRelated('categories');
 *
 * If you are saving several relations you would do:
 * $post->saveWithRelated( array('relation1', 'relation2') );
 *
 * If saving was not successful, then $post->categories will return the data that was set
 * If saving was successful, then the relation will return the related models.
 *
 * When updating a model then all entries in the m:n table for this model are first deleted.
 * (Howto prevent deletion see section "advanced usage")
 *
 * HAS_MANY relations
 * -------------------
 * When a HAS_MANY relation is defined in the relations() function,
 * instances of the foreign model can be added while saving the model.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * author model defines has_many relation with posts:
 * 'posts'=>array(self::HAS_MANY, 'post', 'author_post(author_id, post_id)')
 *
 * To save a new author along with 2 posts you can now do:
 * $author = new author();
 * $author->posts = array(new post(), new post());
 * $author->saveWithRelated('posts');
 * This saves the new author together with two (empty) posts.
 *
 * The typical usage though would be to assign data send from a tabular form
 * Each array entry represents the data for one post
 * $author->posts = array(
 *    array(
 *        'title' => 'My first post',
 *        'content' => 'This is my first post.'
 *    ),
 *    array(
 *        'title' => 'My second post',
 *        'content' => 'This is my second post.'
 *    )
 * );
 * $author->saveWithRelated('posts');
 *
 * So similar to many_many relations you can either pass an array of objects
 * or an array of data that represents the related objects.
 *
 * You can also pass a single object:
 * $author->posts = new post();
 * $author->saveWithRelated('posts');
 *
 * If you are saving several relations you would do:
 * $author->saveWithRelated( array('relation1', 'relation2') );
 *
 * If saving was not successful, then $author->posts will return
 * an array of validated post models which can be used to display
 * the tabular input form along with validation messages
 * If saving was successful, then the relation will return the related models.
 *
 * When updating a model then all records related to this model are first deleted.
 * (Howto prevent deletion see section "advanced usage")
 *
 * You can also specify the scenario to be used for the insertion of the related models:
 * $model->saveWithRelated( array('relationName1' => array('scenario' => 'special')));
 *
 * Advanced usage
 * --------------
 * To save the related data only do:
 * $model->saveRelated( array('relationName1','relationName2') );
 *
 * If you do not want to delete existing related records before insertion do
 * $model->saveWithRelated( array('relationName1' => array('append' => true)));
 * You will have to make sure that the new records are not dublicates of
 * existing records, the behavior does not handle that
